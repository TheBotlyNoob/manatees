    What's going on?
  </h2>

  <p class="max-w-7xl text-center font-bold text-2xl">
    In 2017, manatees in Florida were officially taken off the endangered
    species list, where they had been <span class="text-primary"
      >since 1973</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p class="max-w-7xl text-center font-bold text-2xl">
    In 1991, the manatee count in the state of florida was <span
      class="text-primary">less than 1,300</span
    >. Tremendous efforts and many state and county-imposed speed laws in
    manatee areas allowed the manatee population to bloom to <span
      class="text-primary">over 6,000 in 2024</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p class="max-w-7xl text-center font-bold text-2xl">
    We need to ensure manatee numbers <i class="text-primary">never</i> get to those
    levels again.

    Manatees don't have any natural predators, so why were they endagered?
  </h3>
  <p class="max-w-7xl text-center font-bold text-2xl">
    The main killers of manatees are <span class="text-primary"
      >collisions with boats</span
    >, and many manatees can be injured or killed by engine propellers moving at
    high speeds. Natural killers of manatees include cold snaps which manatees
    cannot cope with due to their lack of blubber, and algal blooms, which can
    block sunlight from reaching the seagrasses that the manatees need to
    survive.

    These manatees have been permanently scarred by boat collisions.

    they are relatively <span class="text-primary"

    >.
  </p>

  <p class="max-w-7xl pt-24 text-center font-bold text-2xl">
    <span class="text-primary">Manatees can be hard to see in the water</span>- they are easily mistaken for rocks
    due to their grayish color. They look like oblique shadows in cloudy water,
    and can be difficult to point out. However, when they come up to the surface
    to breathe, they can be very loud, which alerts you to their presence.

          >Report any you see that look in distress</span
        >- such as tangled in nets, beached, or baby manatees by themselves- to
        the FWC, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. This
        organization has rescue teams that they can send out to help the
        manatees.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-7xl text-center font-bold text-2xl">
        <span class="text-primary">Keep the manatees habitat clean</span>. This
        involves shorelines, beachsides, and canals. If you find any trash in
        these waterways, you should dispose of it accordingly, as any plastic
        that gets mixed with the manatees’ seagrass cannot be digested by them
        and will get tangled in their intestines and kill them.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-7xl text-center font-bold text-2xl">
        <span class="text-primary">Do not touch or feed them</span>! A
        continuous feeding and petting of the manatees, if encouraged, can lead
        to manatees feeling better around humans and more comfortable, which may
        cause them to feel more comfortable with human’s boats, which can make
        them much more susceptible to harm and injury. This is due to the
        over-friendliness of the manatees.
